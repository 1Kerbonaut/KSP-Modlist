Custom Modlist including a alternative Star System (Celestial Harmony) and Kcalbeloh

IMPORTANT:

This Modlist uses Volumetric Clouds. It should work without it, but I never testet it.
If you want to use it just install Volumetric clouds like usual but DONT install the StockVolumetricClouds Folder.
